- Check whether we can easily implement a Pissa-like approach where we just use LoRA but initialize the A and B matrix with the
rows of the U matrix and columns of the V matrix of the top r singular values.  

- How are we going to perform module selection? Will we pick the top-k modules out of all modules that exist in the model? 
or the top-k from each transformer block? --> Probably something per transformer block to make it scalable with the model size
